== DESCRIPTION:

Have you ever wanted to have a copy of all the videos or podcasts from a
site that only provides the links to the files and no RSS feed?  I have
too.  download_agent uses recipes to traverse a website to download
all the videos.  The videos are saved in your Videos folder with a
directory for each site.  Now you don't have to lament not having Internet
access when you want to catch up on your favorite screencasts.  If you
use cron you can add a cron job to check for new videos
